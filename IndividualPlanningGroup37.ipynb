    "For this project, I will focus on the broad question of what player characteristics are more predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter.

    "The Minecraft server logs provide data on each player's activity and session information, allowing me to summarise and use data wrangling to turn the data into summary statistics and metrics for each individual player. By summarising metrics such as total playtime, average session duration, number of sessions, and combining these with the player's subscription status, I will be able to create a dataset suitable for predicting whether player is subscribed to game-related newsletters based on their metrics. At the moment, I feel that K-NN classification will be more suitable compared to linear regression to predict the subscription status of a player based on their summary metrics, because the relationship between the predictors and subscription status is non-linear, and K-NN allows for fewer assumptions about the data."
